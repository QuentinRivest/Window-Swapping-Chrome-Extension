# Window-Swapper Chrome Extension

This is a Chrome Extension that allows you to save browser windows, open your saved windows when you choose, and swap your current window with a window from your saved windows (this last feature being the namesake of the extension). It should be noted that swapping a window will automatically save the state of the current window.

"Saving a window" refers to the extension saving the ordered list of tabs open in the window at the moment it's being saved.

Saved windows are identified by names that the user gives to them the first time they're saved. Window renaming and removal is supported in the list of saved windows displayed through use of the 'Open...' button.
