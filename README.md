# Window-Swapper Chrome Extension

### A Chrome Extension that can swap your current window with other windows you have saved.

Making this because my laptop is kind of old and likes to crash if I have too many windows with too many tabs open, haha.

So basically, if you have one or more window(s) (i.e., a collection of tabs) saved to this chrome extension, then you can decide to swap the current window with one of those saved windows.
Swapping with the current window makes that current window a saved window automatically (no need to manually save it -- that'd be annoying, lol).
